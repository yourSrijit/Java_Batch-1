1. Write a Java program to print 'Hello' on screen and your name on a separate line.


2. Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input and displays the product of two numbers.
Test Data:
Input first number: 25
Input second number: 5
Expected Output :
25 x 5 = 125


3. Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.
Test Data:
Input first number: 125
Input second number: 24
Expected Output :
125 + 24 = 149
