1:Create a class Vehicle with attributes like make, model, and year. Then, create two subclasses, Car and Motorcycle. Implement appropriate constructors and methods to showcase inheritance.

2:Define a class Animal with methods like eat and sleep. Create two subclasses, Mammal and Bird, representing different types of animals. Demonstrate single inheritance, multilavel inheritance, and hierarchical inheritance.

3: Write a program that takes a sentence as input and prints the following:

Number of words in the sentence.
Number of vowels and consonants.
The sentence in reverse order

4:Implement a program that uses StringBuffer to perform the following operations:

Append two strings.
Insert a string at a specific position.
Delete a substring from the buffer.

5:Create a program that uses StringBuilder to perform the following operations:

Concatenate two strings.
Reverse a string.
Replace a substring with another substring.

6:Define a class Shape with a method area(). Create subclasses like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Implement the area() method in each subclass and demonstrate polymorphism by calculating and displaying the area of different shapes.

7:Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method calculateArea(). Implement this class with two subclasses, Circle and Rectangle. Additionally, create an interface Drawable with a method draw(). Implement this interface in the Circle class. Demonstrate the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

Assignment 8: Exception Handling
